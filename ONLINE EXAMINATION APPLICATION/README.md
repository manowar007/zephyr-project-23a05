# TOPIC- ONLINE EXAMINATION APPLICATIONS

OEA is a system that helps institutes provide their students with an online exam platform. The system has two types of users which are the Admin and the Students/Examinee.

The Admin user will be using the admin panel of the system that they are in charge of populating and maintaining the system’s data. They will manage the list of Courses, Exams, Exam Questionnaires, and Examinees. The admin user can view the exam results and feedback of the students.

The Student Users can only take the exam, view their results, and send feedback to the admin. Talking about the student taking the exam, the exam will only be created with a limited time duration. Every student who will start to take the exam will only be allowed to finish answering that by the given period.

It may be used as a tool  to overcome the limitation of traditional pen and paper examinations.
